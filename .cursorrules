## Git Commit Messages
When generating git commit messages:
- **ALWAYS use a prefix** (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore)
- Keep the main message under 50 characters INCLUDING the prefix
- Use imperative mood after the prefix
- Be specific but concise
- No periods at the end
- Format: `prefix: message`
- **Language**: Always use Japanese for commit messages

### Prefix Rules (Angular Convention):
- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `test:` Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

### Code Comments Language:
- **For international projects**: Use English comments
- **For domestic Japanese projects**: Use Japanese comments (コメントを日本語で記述した場合)
- Choose based on your team's preference and project requirements
